# How To Participate in a yVault

This visual guide will walk you through every step in depositing funds in a [yVault](https://docs.yearn.finance/products/yvaults).

## Prerequisites

- You must have the yVault's underlying token. For DAI yVault, you must have DAI.
- You must use a supported wallet, either Metamask, Trustwallet, Trezor, or Torus.

## Walkthrough

### 6. Approve and Deposit

Depositing for the first time requires making two transactions, one approval, and one deposit. Approval is one-time, subsequent deposits can be made in a single transaction. Please ensure there is **ETH in your wallet** to cover the gas cost on Ethereum.

- Approval (first time only)
  - Enter from 0 to 100% of your wallet DAI balance then click "Deposit"
  - Confirm the transaction in your wallet
- Deposit
  - Enter from 0 to 100% of your wallet DAI balance then click "Deposit"
  - Confirm the transaction in your wallet

**Please note:** Depending on the vault you deposit into, fees may be applied. For more info see the [relevant section in the FAQ](../faq.md#what-are-the-fees).

### 7. Receive your yToken (in this case it would be yDAI)

The yDAI you receive is your **share of the DAI Vault**. The amount of yDAI in your wallet will **remain constant** over time but the value of it will increase as the DAI Vault earns returns.

The amount of yDAI you receive will be less than 1 per DAI you deposited because yDAI is worth more than 1 DAI.

For example, at block number 10611372 yDAI was equal to 1.044 DAI. Therefore had you deposited 100 DAI, you would have received 95.78 yDAI (100 / 1.044).

### 8. Track your earnings
